    "Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the subclass to override the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of method overriding:\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",

    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Child class method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "parent_obj = Parent()\n",
    "parent_obj.show_info()  # Output: Parent class method\n",
    "\n",
    "child_obj = Child()\n",
    "child_obj.show_info()  # Output: Child class method\n",
    "\n",
    "the Child class inherits from the Parent class and overrides the show_info() method. When calling the method on a Child object, the overridden implementation in the Child class is executed instead of the one in the Parent class. \n",
    "Method overriding allows for polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated uniformly based on a common interface\n",
